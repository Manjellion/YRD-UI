In our UML diagram we focus mainly on brining the connection towards residents and business owners as they have a clear link, however tourists have the same unified inception also so the resident actor represents both residents and tourists interactivity with the business owners.

Here we have our initial navigation structure of the webpage as represented as a flow chart, the decision is esentially when the end users are asked if they are a residents, tourist or business owners, we can direct they end user to who they are make the route of the website for them lead to a more personalised webpage that will be more engaging and better user experience overall.
